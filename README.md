## Vehicle Cut-in Detection

The Vehicle Cut-in Detection System is an advanced driver-assistance solution aimed at enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. Utilizing a combination of radar, Lidar, and cameras, the system collects real-time data to identify and respond to vehicles cutting into the lane. Machine learning algorithms, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, are employed to detect objects, predict vehicle behavior, and assess risks. The system integrates with existing ADAS functionalities, providing instant feedback and corrective actions through threat assessment and response strategies. Additionally, it includes V2X communication for enhanced situational awareness and a driver alert mechanism for manual driving scenarios. The project encompasses phases from research and sensor integration to algorithm development, system implementation, and extensive testing, ultimately aiming to reduce collision rates and improve detection accuracy under diverse driving conditions.
